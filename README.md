# Robust Optimization in Portfolio Management
MIT 15.093 Optimization Methods Final Project

## Requirement
Gurobi >= 9.5.2, Python >= 3.6, Julia >= v1.8

## How to Use
Copy all the source code in `src` directory to `data` directory to run the files. The Colab file should be run using Google Colab.

## Summary
This project combines the advantages of both Python and Julia to do nonlinear but convex (quadratic) optimization, hopefully providing some help to people of similar interest as relevant coding resources are surprisingly rare.

For a quick summary, check the `result` directory for the poster presentation.
