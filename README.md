# Robust Optimization in Portfolio Management
MIT 15.093 Optimization Methods Final Project

This project combines the advantages of both **Python** and **Julia** to do **nonlinear** but **convex (quadratic)** optimization, hopefully providing some help to people of similar interest as relevant coding resources are surprisingly rare.

## Requirement
Gurobi >= 9.5.2, Python >= 3.6, Julia >= v1.8

## How to Use
Copy all the source code in `src` directory to `data` directory to run the files. The Colab file should be run using Google Colab.

## Summary

- **Robust portfolio management** that achieves target return and minimizes risk simultaneously.
- More resilient to noises and changes in market such as a **Black Swan** event.
- Formulation with **ellipsoidal uncertainty set**.
